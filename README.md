# sql-challenge

Overview

This project involves the creation and management of a database schema for a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard. The database consists of six tables: departments, dept_manager, dept_emp, employees, salaries, and titles. Each table is designed with appropriate primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity. The project also includes the import of  employee data from CSV files and the execution of various SQL queries to retrieve specific information about employees, department managers, and salary details. The schema and queries are organized in two .sql files as seen above.
